# fizzbuzz
Add files that play FizzBuzz in all the programming languages I've used so far. Focus is on easy ability to add more conditions (7 -> "Bizz") for example. Adding each new condition should take no more than 1-2 new lines of code for each programming language. That does not apply to fizzbuzz.html (made as a joke) or fizzbuzz.asm (designed to be fast), however.
